## Project Overview

As a web developer working with **Django** and inspired by the minimalistic approach of **HTMX**, I created this repository to bundle together a few essential front-end tools. 
The goal is to provide an easy way for developers to get started with web development, with the most commonly used libraries included in a simple, one-shot CDN.

### The `build.css` file includes:
- `primeflex.css` (flexbox-based utility classes)
- `primeicons` (icon library)
- `simple.css` (a minimal CSS framework)

### The `build.js` file includes:
- `jquery.js` (JavaScript library)
- `htmx.org` (HTML over-the-wire)
- Other basic required libraries to make web development more efficient

With these two files, you can start building your project with ease, without needing to manually include each of these libraries.
