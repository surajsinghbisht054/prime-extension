You can toggle between light/dark themes. Just change `primeone-light.css` to `primeone-dark.css`
### CDN


Using jsDelivr CDN
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prime-extension@latest/dist/main.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prime-extension@latest/dist/themes/primeone-light.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prime-extension@latest/dist/main.js"></script>
```


## Why?
As a web developer working with **Django** and inspired by the minimalistic approach of **HTMX**, 
I created this repository to bundle together a few essential front-end tools. 
The goal is to provide an easy way for developers to get started with web development, with the most commonly used libraries included in a simple, one-shot CDN.

### The `build.css` file includes:
- `primeflex.css` (flexbox-based utility classes) [primeflex.org](https://primeflex.org/)
- `primeicons` (icon library) [Primeicons](https://primevue.org/icons)
- `simple.css` (a minimal CSS framework) [simplecss.org](https://simplecss.org/)

### The `build.js` file includes:
- `jquery.js` (JavaScript library) [jquery.com](https://jquery.com/)
- `htmx.org` (HTML over-the-wire) [htmx.org](https://htmx.org/)
- Other basic required libraries to make web development more efficient

With these two files, you can start building your project with ease, without needing to manually include each of these libraries.



## Why Use This Bundle?

- **Minimalistic**: Contains only the most essential libraries to get started, so you donâ€™t have to worry about bloated code.
- **Quick Setup**: Just use the CDN provided in this repo to include all the required packages in your project in one go.
- **Django Friendly**: Perfect for developers using Django as their backend framework, since it's designed with that in mind.
- **Future Proof**: The project is open to adding more libraries and improvements, and contributions are welcome.
